Files live here in the sandbox for production and post teams.  Find names and descriptions of each of the utilities that can be found here.

**CopyFiles.py**
> For OSX users only running Python2, there is an updated version for Python3+ but is not made available here.

To use you will need to copy **all** files to be renamed into a *LOCAL* folder on your desktop before proceeding. Please see the attached file **CopyFilesSku.csv** as an example of how to construct your file.  This utility will do *Partial* and *full* filename matching.  So if you need to change one sku to another you will place the donor sku in the first and the final sku in the second column.  Please create your CSV in excel and **SAVE-AS** a **Microsoft CSV**.
